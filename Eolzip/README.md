# EolZip
## What is EolZip
Written in cpp, EolZip is a compression software zipping files using huffman coding, which is no more than a homework task. You will not want to read the source codes because it s**ks. Nor will you want to actually put it into use at any time, or you will regret that you had ever learned to use a computer.

## Build & Install
### on Linux or OS X
Simply `make` to build. You can just stop here, and use the `ezip` in this directory.
It is unwize to install it on your computer, although it does provide this feature. Just `make install` after building, and Ezip will be installed at `/usr/local/bin/`.
You can always use `make uninstall` to rid your computer of it, and use `make clean` to clean the built objects.

### on Windows
You must be our TA! Thank you for all the time you have spended on our homework while I'm sorry to have you wasted your time reading this. You can read the homework report for a TA-friendly description.

## Usage
### on Linux or OS X
When installed (which I have warned you not to), use `ezip [OPTION]... [FILE]...`. Use `ezip --help` for more detail.
When not installed (but recommended), just replace `ezip` with its path.
